"3 - Minimal Model Generation For Testing" should be used for building and testing the 2 models as quickly as possible by viewing it on GitHub and clicking the open in colab button. This is a minimal python kernel notebook that builds the models and tests them.

- "1 - Analysis" uses an R kernel to analyse the dataset.
- "2 - Model Generation" uses a python kernel to build multiple models and search for an optimal linear and DNN model respectively.
- 1_collated_dataset is the dataset directly retrieved using the collect_and_collate_data query from BigQuery.
- 2_cleaned_dataset is the dataset after analysis and some cleaning.
